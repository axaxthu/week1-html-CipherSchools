<!--LINE BREAK-->    
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
<br>
And sorry I could not travel both
<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood
<br>
And looked down one as far as I could
<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,
<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,
<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<br>
Though as for that the passing there
<br>
Had worn them really about the same,
<br>

And both that morning equally lay
<hr>
In leaves no step had trodden black.

    "THE STARLIGHT NIGHT" was 
      one of two poems which Hopkins
      sent to his mother as a birthday present,

    the other poem being "God's Grandeur"
           What a birthday present!
